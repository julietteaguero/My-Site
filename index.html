<p style= "text-align: center;">Hey there!</p>
<p style= "text-align: center;"> My name is Juliette Aguero, I'm 17 years old and I'll be a senior this fall at Young Womens Prep Academy. I am hoping to attend Florida State University and major in accounting after graduating from high school.
I'm Cuban and Puerto Rican and I have an older brother who'll be 19 next month. In my spare time I like to go out with my friends and spend time with family.</p>
<p style= "text-align: center;">Likes: I really like Night Owl, Mr. Kream and sushi. I like the color white and the number 6.</p>
<p style= "text-align: center;">Dislikes: I really don't like roaches.
<p style= "text-align: center;">Fun Fact: I've been on a swim team since I was 10 and I swim every day. Another fun fact, my biggest fear is drowning.</p>
